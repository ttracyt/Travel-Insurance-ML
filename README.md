# Travel Insurance Machine Learning
The goal of this project is to determine the likelihood of customers purchasing travel insurance. By using historical data on previous customers who did or did not purchase insurance, we can determine the probability of future customers purchasing insurance. This model would greatly benefit travel insurance companies or companies that sells travel insurance. It would help business leaders make informed decisions such as whether they should make improvements to their marketing strategies.
